# BUDHI_LATER🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ZERO PURPOSE


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Arshad V A - MACE
- Member 2: Ameena R

### Project Description
BUDHILATER is a “calculator” that refuses to calculate anything. Instead, it asks silly questions, pretends to think very hard, and finally gives you useless answers you never needed.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many calculators are actually… calculating. This creates an unrealistic expectation that every calculator must give correct answers. This is exhausting for society.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built BUDHILATER — the only calculator that will never burden itself with mathematics. Instead, it will waste your time in style, deliver sarcastic replies, and keep your brain mathematically unfit.

## Team Contributions
-Arshad – Designed the calculator interface so it looks functional but is actually gloriously useless. Created the dramatic fake loading animation that keeps users waiting for absolutely nothing.

Ameena R – Came up with the idea of a calculator that refuses to calculate. Wrote all the sarcastic pre-questions, witty replies, and ensured every result is as unhelpful as possible.
